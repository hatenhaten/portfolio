                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi, I'm a husband and father who's been on a long and winding road to reach the point where I'm here typing this HTML for you to read.</p>
                <p>The journey started during my time working as a sustainability consultant shortly after completing my Masters. As I sat there, writing environmental impact reports for the great and the good of the engineering world, I began to have this niggling feeling that I could and should be doing more to solve the issues I was writing about.</p>
                <p>Feeling at odds with the 'consume less' narrative put forward by many environmentalists, I was looking for something different. The goal of stopping resource exploitation is of course a necessity on a planet of finite resources, but for me it always sounded unrealistic to expect people to go backwards in their habits in order to acheive it. The work of organisations such as the Elen McArthur Foundation and the work of Authors such as Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams inspired my growing belief that instead we should be building a thriving future where consumption is not limited, but made circular through leveraging advanced. Essentially, with the right systems in place, I believe humanity can have their cake and eat it.</p>
                <p>Let's jump back to me sitting there writing reports that no-one would ever read and wondering how I could contribute to this bright technology driven future I had envisioned... Learning to Code seemed a logical first step!</p>
