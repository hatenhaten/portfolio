        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm a husband and father who has been on a long and winding journey to end up here typing this HTML for you to read.</p>
        <p>A fascination wih the potential for novel technologies to solve some of the worlds most pressing issues got me interested in code. While I was working in a sustainability consultancy writing reports I realised that I could be doing more to solve the issues I was writing about. Learning to Code seemed a logical first step.</p>
